<h1>Our Project</h1>
<p>Our group decided to try to solve the problem with not being able to find a parking spot.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="font-size:140%;">How?</h2>
<p2> There were many different ways we thought to solve this but the direction we decided upon is to put cameras with raspberry pi into the parking lots. Then have the camera to take pictures of the lot at many different angles, feed those pictures into an edge detection program to tell if there is a car in a spot. Then feed the data into a web app. The whole goal is to be able to open a web app select the lot then see the open parking spots. </p2>

<h3 style="font-size:140%;">Background information</h3>
<p3>A raspberry pi is a small credit card sized computer.</p3>
<p6>It uses a SoC: Broadcom BCM2711B0 quad-core A72 (ARMv8-A) 64-bit @ 1.5GHz cpu, a GPU: Broadcom VideoCore VI, for Networking it has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN. For random access memory 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB LPDDR4 SDRAM. And Bluetooth 5.0.

<h5 style="font-size:140%;">Edge Detection</h5>
<p4>Edge detection is taking a pcitire and finding the edges. The way the computer will prcess the information is by looking at the number of white pixles in a specified area. If there are more than x the program can conclude that an object or in our case a car is there.  It looks like this.
